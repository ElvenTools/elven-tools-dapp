# 1. By commenting this out the dapp will use the default
#    MultiversX api endpoint (e.g. https://devnet-api.elrond.com)
#
#    Note: MULTIVERSX_PRIVATE_API needs to be removed/commented out.
#
# 2. Set this to an absolute address to use a custom MultiversX api endpoint
#    (e.g. http://dev.mydomain.com)
#
#    Note: MULTIVERSX_PRIVATE_API needs to be removed/commented out.
#
# 3. Enter a relative path to proxy/mask your MultiversX api endpoint (e.g. /api/multiversx)
#    Only current instance of the Dapp can use it if only API_ALLOWED_DAPP_HOST is set.
#
#    Note: MULTIVERSX_PRIVATE_API must include the actual MultiversX API endpoint.
