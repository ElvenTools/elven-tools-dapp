### [3.1.0](https://github.com/ElvenTools/elven-tools-dapp/releases/tag/v3.1.0) (2022-08-06)

### [3.0.0](https://github.com/ElvenTools/elven-tools-dapp/releases/tag/v3.0.0) (2022-07-10)
- some of the configurations for a smart contract are now fetched automatically
- UX is essential, and the previous approach to sc-related configs was problematic and not clear
- the only gain was saving on API bandwidth, but I think it should be ok with future improvements, mainly SWR and service worker cache, but also using third-party API providers, not public ones, which should be evident for production-ready dapp
- still, you can remove the queries and configure all as constants in the app, but it won't be provided as a simple option for now because it would still introduce a lot of confusion
- new hook useElvenScQuery which uses generic useScQuery (both are now better typed)
- new return type for useScQuery - boolean, it also uses generics to be able to define typings better (preparation for future result parser)
- next, react, swr, chakra ui version updates
- better esling configuration
