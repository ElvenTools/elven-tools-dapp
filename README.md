The Dapp is built using Nextjs and a couple of helpful tools. It allows you to interact with the MultiversX blockchain and smart contracts, and especially it is prepared for the [Elven Tools Smart Contract](https://github.com/ElvenTools/elven-nft-minter-sc). But you can always modify it and adjust it for your needs.

### It provides:

- Signing with 4 MultiversX blockchain [providers](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/)
  - Web Wallet
  - xPortal mobile app
  - MultiversX DeFi browser extension
  - Ledger Nano
- [Guarderd transactions](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-dapp/internal-processes/guardians/#specifications-of-a-guarded-transaction)
- React hooks for making transactions
- React hooks for querying smart contracts
- Tools and React hooks for app state synchronization
- Optional API endpoint rewrites
- Preconfigured UI based on [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- The template with sections mainly used on minter dapps (it will be developed further)

### @useElven/core

The template is based on `@useelven/core` npm library.

Besides that, there are custom React components and hooks that will help you with development.

### Tracking the progress

- [Elven Tools Dapp kanban](https://github.com/orgs/ElvenTools/projects/2)

1. npm install -g elven-tools
2. elven-tools init-dapp
3. cd your-dapp-directory
5. npm run dev

--- or ---

1. clone or download the repo code
2. cd elven-tools-dapp
3. npm install
4. configure .env.local (you can copy the contents of the .env.example)
6. npm run dev

Check detailed docs on it here: [How to start with the Dapp](https://www.elven.tools/docs/how-to-start-with-the-dapp.html)

### Main assumption for the dapp:

- it works on Nextjs
- it uses the newest version of [sdk-core](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-js-core) without the [sdk-dapp](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-dapp) library.
- optionally it uses backend-side rewrites to hide the API endpoint, then the only exposed one is `/api`
- it uses .env file - there is an example in the repo
- it uses [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/)
